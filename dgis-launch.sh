# This is a script to install Gentoo in a partially interactive manner, it gives a baseline install 
# configured with Gentoo itself, a kernel, bootloader, some necessary applications, etc. while giving the 
# flexibility to be prompted for desktop environment or window manager (or none at all if you choose), 
# display manager, along with locale, time zone, usernames, passwords, hostname and other user specific 
# selections.
#
# The intended use is that first your partitioning is done as you wish, you run the script and it handles
# everything up the point of configuring the fstab or any additional options your grub configuration may
# require. This is intended as both partitioning and /etc/fstab have a lot of choice and potential for 
# custom configuration and a one size fits all solution does not work for all.
#
# Procedure:
# 1. Mount root on /mnt/gentoo (and other partitions where they belong if they are seperate from root)
# 2. cd to /mnt/gentoo
# 3. clone repo
# 4. Run the script with bash dgis-launch.sh
# 5. Edit the /etc/fstab with your partitions
# 6. Reboot

# Default root mount directory
DESTINATION=/mnt/gentoo
